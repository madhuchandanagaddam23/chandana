JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler is a part of the JVM’s Execution Engine.
Instead of interpreting bytecode line by line, JIT compiles frequently used bytecode into native machine code (CPU instructions) at runtime.
Once compiled, the machine code can be executed directly by the processor — much faster than interpretation.
